=== About data fixtures ===

To add your own prepopulation (teachers, subjects, etc) edit the files in
applications/ForCA/models/xtures with the desired data.
(Trust me, this *IS* the best way to prepopulate on GAE)

.

== About pictures ===

The teachers' default pictures are *NOT* stored in the database. They are
stored in the applications/ForCA/static/profs directory.
When showing the picture, the view checks if the field 'picture' for that
given techer is empty in the database. If it is, then the default picture
is shown instead.
A little gotcha: by default, the system expects all files in this directory
to be .jpg . Also, the name of the file must match the first part of the
teacher's e-mail (everything before the '@').
You can fiz all this mess my editing the prof/home view.
